            <h3 class="question">What does being a staff member entail?</h3>
            <p class="description">Jabberwocky meets once a week to discuss the submissions. At the beginning of each week, you will receive a folder on Google Drive with  submissions for the committee you are a part of. Your job is to read and analyze those submissions, and bring any ideas/notes you have on why each submission should or should not be included in the journal.
            <h3 class="question">What are the different roles within Jabberwocky?</h3>
            <p class="description">There are four staffs you could be a part of: poetry, fiction, media, or nonfiction/criticism. If you’re feeling you want more responsibility, you can apply to be a head editor which would require you to be in charge of leading the discussions for that staff.</p>
            <h3 class="question">What happens after all submissions are chosen?</h3>
            <p class="description">Once we stop receiving submissions, if selected you can help copy edit the journal and design the layout! After it’s all complete and printed, we celebrate with a launch party for all staff and authors to attend!</p>
            <h3 class="question">Why should I join Jabberwocky?</h3>
            <p class="description">Being a part of Jabberwocky is a very rewarding expereince. You will gain editing skills, collaboration skills, analyzation skills, as well as become part of a team dedicated to spreading the love of literature and art at UMass. Each printed journal is a reminder of the hardwork you have done and a reminder of the friendships you have made by being a part of the Jabberwocky community.</p>
