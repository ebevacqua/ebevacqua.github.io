        <main class="sample">
            <p class="synopsis"><a class="button" href="grant.pdf">Authors-In-Schools In Springfield, Massachusetts (PDF)</a><br>
            Part of the PWTC certificate includes a class which teaches you how to conduct a feasibilty study and write a faux grant proposal. Looking to connect my personal goals to the project, I discovered a nonprofit named Wondermore which aims to inspire children to read and write through classroom visits from authors and illustrators. This 14-page faux grant propsal asks The Wagner Foundation to provide funds for the expansion of their Authors-In-Schools program to Springfield, MA.</p>
            <p class="synopsis"><a class="button" href="manual.pdf">Tutoring with Microsoft Word (PDF)</a><br>
            One of my most memorable projects from the PWTC certificate is my task-orientated manual for writing tutors about Microsoft Word. Through extensive research and experimenting with Word, this project taught me best techniques for writing clear instructions geared towards a specific audience. My manual is 18 pages of the best tools to use while tutoring in an online environment.</p>
            <p class="synopsis"><a class="button" href="https://blendtw.com/author/emilybevacqua/" target="_blank">Articles from BLENDtw</a><br>
            During my internship at the BLENDtw, I spent every week pitching, researching, and writing unique stories for publication. BLENDtw aims to inform and empower the voices of our people and as an Editorial Intern, I was able to help share stories that connected college students lives thorughout the world. Ten stories I submitted were published online and promoted on their social media. This is a link to my profile which contains all of my published work.</p>
            <p class="synopsis"><a class="button" href="client-site/index.html" target="_blank">Sample HTML Website</a><br>
            This client-website was created as a class project to showcase my HTML and CSS skills. At the time, I was Managing Editor of <em>Jabberwocky</em>, the English Department's literary journal, and I created this site to explain to UMass undergraduates who we are, what we do, and how they can contribute!</p>
            <p class="synopsis"><a class="button" href="./pdf/e-m-I-l-y.pdf">E-M-I-L-Y (PDF)</a><br>
            As a creative prompt in class one day, I wrote this brief personal story about my existential crisis in the fourth grade when too many people had my very generic first name and how I coped.</p>
            <p class="synopsis"><a class="button" href="board.pdf">Board Again? (PDF)</a><br>
            This four-page personal essay discusses the struggles of finding entertainment when growing up in a small town. My friends and I discovered our love for board game and this essay dives into how our deep bond continues to grow closer despite our competitive nature. </p>
